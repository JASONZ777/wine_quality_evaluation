To summarize, the paper improvement stage addresses the challenge of imbalanced data labels by em-
ploying a combination of over-sampling (SMOTE) and under-sampling (Tomek Link) methods, resulting
in a more balanced dataset. The evaluation of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models reveals
that Random Forest outperforms Gradient Boosting, with additional improvement observed when using
SMOTE+TomekLink. The examination of precision variations indicates that Random Forest, particularly
with SMOTE+TomekLink, stands out as the most effective model. These findings emphasize the impor-
tance of addressing class imbalances and the potential of ensemble learning techniques for wine quality
assessment. Further investigations could explore nuanced aspects of feature importance and classification
accuracy for continued refinement of model performance.
